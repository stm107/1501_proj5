Additional comments to the grader:
I separated my code into the functions that Dr. Farnan asked for above and any helper functions below.
They are labeled and heavily commented.

I wrote a test driver called LargeIntegerTest.java that performs all of the operations required by the assignemnt.
It then does the same calculation with the BigInteger class and compares the result.
NOTE: I did NOT use BigInteger to create any parts of LargeInteger, just to test :).

I have run into on a small unlucky occasion, the scenario when the randomly generated e is repeatedly greater than phi_n.
A new e then generated, and if it is also greater than phi_n, then it just keeps generating new e until it gets one that works.
This has, once or twice, taken a while. It usually doesn't happen though.
